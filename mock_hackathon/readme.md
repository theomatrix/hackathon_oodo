# Skill Swap
# What problem were we solving?

In college, every student has some skill — like someone knows coding, someone is good at designing, someone teaches music, or maybe public speaking.
But there is no easy way for students to connect and exchange their skills.

We saw that students want to learn new things, but either they can't afford paid classes, or they don’t know who can help them.
So the main problem was:

> "How can we help students find and learn skills from each other without money?"

# Our Idea – Skill Swap

We thought:

> What if we create a simple platform where users can make a profile, write what skills they offer and what they want to learn, and then send a request to someone who matches?



And from that, we created:
Skill Swap – a skill exchange platform for students 🤝


 # What does the platform do?

Students can register/login with email (Firebase Auth)

They can create a profile (skills offered & skills wanted)

They can browse other users publicly

They can view someone’s profile and send a swap request

They can see their sent/received requests and their status

The platform works on mobile and desktop both

And it also supports dark mode 🌙

# ⚙️ What tools did we use?

Tool	Why we used it

React.js	To build a fast frontend
Firebase Auth	To manage login/signup
Firestore	To store user data & requests
Tailwind CSS	For a clean responsive design
Firebase Hosting	To make the app live online


# 🎯 Why is this project useful?

It gives students a way to learn new skills without paying money

It helps people connect based on what they know and what they want to learn

It’s completely free, scalable, and beginner-friendly

It encourages peer-to-peer learning, which is more relatable and comfortable

# 🔚 Conclusion

> Skill Swap is not just a project — it's a simple way to bring learners and teachers together in one place.
We’ve built it using free tools like Firebase and React, so that anyone can use it — from college students to communities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
