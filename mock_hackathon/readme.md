# Skill Swap

🚀 *Skill Swap* is a simple frontend-only prototype web application built for a hackathon to connect people and help them exchange skills in a peer-to-peer community.

It’s made with *plain React, **React Router, and **basic CSS* — no backend or database yet — just a working prototype to show the idea.

✅ Login / Sign Up Page (static)  
✅ User Dashboard Page (static)
